My approach at using Machine Learning for daytrading. 


Welcome to my repository documenting my journey in applying Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to day trading. The goal is to explore how these technologies can be used to make informed and profitable trading decisions.

# Overview
Day trading is a highly dynamic and complex field that relies on analyzing market trends and making decisions within short time frames. Through this project, I aim to:

Experiment with various ML and RL techniques.
Analyze their effectiveness in predicting market movements.
Optimize strategies for better profitability and risk management.
This repository serves as a log of my trials, successes, and lessons learned in applying advanced computational methods to real-world trading.

# Current Progress
Attempt 1: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Model
The first phase of the project focused solely on using Reinforcement Learning to develop a trading strategy. Hereâ€™s an outline of what I achieved in this attempt:


Dataset: Apple stock intraday data
Environment: Open-AI gym based environment
Key Features:
Training the agent to maximize returns by buying, holding, or selling.
Evaluation of model performance against buy and hold
